# ElementController Linux and macOS Sample

Overview

This is an Linux or macOS server application created using [ElementalController](https://github.com/robreuss/ElementalController) for demo purposes.  It is designed to be used with it's client-side iOS counterpart [ElementalController iOS Sample App](https://github.com/robreuss/ElementalController_iOS_Sample.git).  

The two apps mimic a scenario where an iOS app is being used to control a Raspberry Pi-based robot vehicle, by sending commands and a speed value, along with motion data, just for demo purposes.  There is no actual robot involved, just a console log.
